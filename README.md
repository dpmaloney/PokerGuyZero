* [RLCard](https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard) - Interesting lib for reinforcement, might not be that useful
* [DeepStack Leduc](https://github.com/lifrordi/DeepStack-Leduc) - DeepStack, written in ?lua? tho
* [CFR Basic](http://modelai.gettysburg.edu/2013/cfr/cfr.pdf) - Basic Counterfactual Regret Min
* [CFR Level 2](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4569-efficient-monte-carlo-counterfactual-regret-minimization-in-games-with-many-player-actions.pdf) - Fancy nips paper about CFR, might implement later
* [CFR For dummies](https://int8.io/counterfactual-regret-minimization-for-poker-ai/) - CFR Explained by not confusing papers b/c I am dumb
